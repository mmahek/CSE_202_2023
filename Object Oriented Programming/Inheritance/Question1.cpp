/*
Suppose you are designing a program to manage information about employees in a company. Create a C++ program with the following classes:

Person class with the following attributes and methods:

Attributes:
string name (the person's name)
int age (the person's age)
Methods:
A constructor to initialize name and age.
A method displayInfo() that displays the person's name and age.
Employee class, which inherits from Person, with the following additional attributes and methods:

Attributes:
int employeeId (the employee's unique identifier)
double salary (the employee's salary)
Methods:
A constructor to initialize name, age, employeeId, and salary.
A method displayInfo() that overrides the displayInfo() method in the Person class. It should display the person's name, age, employee ID, and salary.
Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of these classes. Create at least one Person object and one Employee object and display their information using the displayInfo() method.

Example:

Person person1("Alice", 30);
Employee employee1("Bob", 25, 1001, 50000.0);

person1.displayInfo();
employee1.displayInfo();
Output:

Name: Alice
Age: 30
Name: Bob
Age: 25
Employee ID: 1001
Salary: $50000.00


Constraints:

Ensure that the Employee class inherits from the Person class and correctly overrides the displayInfo() method.
Use appropriate data types and formatting for displaying employee information.
